# This is my version of the solutions for Karel.

**It does not matter if what you've got is different, there are multiple solutions.**

I have coded together this repository in 6 hours, so there can be bugs.
Even though I don't think the code might malfunction, please do contact me if it does and you have a way to do so.

I hope this might help some people.
